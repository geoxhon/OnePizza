# OnePizza
My solution for Googles OnePizza problem.
Each ingredient receives a score depending on how many people like/dislike that ingredient.
A random client is selected and a pizza that suits him is made.
For each client we get their list of ingredients and depending on the ingredient score we add it on the pizza.
